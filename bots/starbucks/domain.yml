# NOTE: for many of these responses we may want to include a button or image but we need 
# info from the cart - like if we want to offer buttons for size options, we need to get the size
# info from the item in the cart. Similarity we could offer buttons and/or images of available stores,
# categories, recommendations, etc. But this info is in cart.py. That means these responses must be 
# moved to custom actions in order to interface with cart.py
